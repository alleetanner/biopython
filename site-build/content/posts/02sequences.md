## BioPython's `Seq` class

`Seq` is a class in the BioPython library. A class allows us to create objects that contain both data, and functions we can run on that data. You should have used _variables_ (boxes containing data) and _functions_ (tools for acting on data); a _class_ combines both of these. If this is confusing, don't worry too much! It just means that we can make special strings with `Seq`, designed for molecular biology. This makes manipulating sequencing information easier, with a clean syntax.

In your Jupyter Lab text editor, start a new script by importing `Seq` like this:

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
```

Let's start by creating a short string of DNA. We can then call `Seq` on it to create a new object, called `dna_seq`. 

```python
# Create a string of valid DNA
dna_string = "CATTACTTTGGCGGAAAAATATTT"
# Feed dna_string into Seq to create a Seq object
dna_seq = Seq(dna_string)
# Have a look at this new object
print(dna_seq)
```

(This command _could_ be done with a single command of `dna_seq = Seq("CATTACTTTGGCGGAAAAATATTT")`, but we'll keep it as two steps for clarity. You might be reading sequence information in from a file, so it is worth being explicit about where the data is coming from.)

Save your file, and in the terminal run the file using `python`. 

We can examine our `dna_seq` object in other ways, so let's do that with:

```python
print(type(dna_seq))
print(dir(dna_seq))
```

These will print out what kind of object our `dna_seq` is, as well as the methods associated with it. Don't worry too much about all the `__special_methods__` there.

You will come across mysterious functions with `__double__ __underscores__` in Python. These are

Notice the methods attributed to the `Seq` object, at the end of the list. You can learn more about how to use these methods in [the BioPython documentation for `Seq`](https://biopython.org/wiki/Seq). Remove these `type` and `dir` lines from your script, they will make your terminal a bit messy and hard to read!

{{< admonition type="info" title="Remember to save your script!" open=false >}}
It is very easy to forget to save your script before running it! Jupyter Lab will tell you if a file is modified without saving, with the circle in the tab title. A `ctrl-S` will save it quickly. Also remember to be in the right folder in the terminal, when you are running your script.

### Transcription

You'll see one of the methods of `Seq` is `transcribe()`, so let's do that and turn our DNA into RNA:

```python
rna_seq = dna_seq.transcribe()
print(rna_seq)
```

We might also want to get the complement of this RNA strand. Since `rna_seq` is also a `Seq` object, we can call one of the methods, `complement_rna()`:

```python
rna_complement = rna_seq.complement_rna()
print(rna_complement)
```

It is also possible to convert back from an RNA sequence to a DNA sequence:

```python
dna_from_rna = rna_seq.back_transcribe()
```

Which, in this case, _should_ give us back the original data - we can check that by asking "are these two objects identical?":

```python
if dna_seq == dna_from_rna:
    print("Yes, they are identical.")
else:
    print("No, they differ.")
```

### Translation
The next thing we might want to do with this nucleotide sequence is see what amino acid sequence it would translate to (let's assume our sequence is protein-coding for a tiny polypeptide!). 

```python
protein_seq = rna_seq.translate()
print(protein_seq)
```

Note that this will always translate forward using the first nucleotide as the open reading frame. Try altering the raw DNA sequence (say, apply indels, or include an invalid nucleotide) to break this kind of translation. You should be getting a `BiopythonWarning`, or a `Bio.Data.CodonTable.TranslationError` - read these tracebacks and pick out the important information it is giving you.

### Create DNA reader `function`
Let's build these into a function, for viewing the complement, transcription and translation of some DNA. Begin a new script with:
```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq

def complement_transcribe_translate(dna):
    print(f"My incoming DNA: {dna}")
```
We begin with defining the function, give it a descriptive name, and declare that it takes one argument called `dna`. The function body is currently just printing out a confirmation of the input. Test that the function is working by creating a `Seq` object of the nucleotides `TTACCAAAAACCCCTTTGGGAAAGCAT`, and calling your function on it.

Let's expand on this, using `Seq` methods, to satisfy our descriptive function name!
```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq

def complement_transcribe_translate(dna):
    print(f"My incoming DNA: {dna}")
    
    complement = dna.complement()
    print(f"Complementary strand: {complement}")
    
    transcribed_forward = complement.transcribe()
    print(f"Complement transcription: {transcribed_forward}")
    
    amino_acids_forward = transcribed_forward.translate()
    print(f"Amino acid translation: {amino_acids_forward}")

dna_seq = Seq("TTACCAAAAACCCCTTTGGGAAAGCAT")

complement_transcribe_translate(dna_seq)
```

### Exercise
{{< admonition type="note" title="Exercise" open=true >}}
Create a reverse DNA reader! 
- Building on your script from the last secion, add a new function to _reverse_ complement, translate and transcribe.
- Use the code below as a template (ie, fill the `___` gaps!).
- When run on the command line, your script should neatly output the manipulations to the incoming raw DNA.
- Include a `docstring`, add `#comments` and format your functions neatly!

Once you have a working script:
- Which of the two reading directions is probably correct?
- Why?

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq


def reverse_complement_transcribe_translate(dna):
    """
    Very good students fill out the docstring too! 
    """
    dna_reverse = dna.___()
    print(f"As a reverse complement:   {___}")
    
    transcribed_backward = dna_reverse.___()
    print(f"Reverse transcription:     {___}")
    
    amino_acids_backward = transcribed_backward.___()
    print(f"Amino acids reading <-     {___}")


# here is my incoming DNA sequence, made into a Seq object
dna_seq = Seq("TTACCAAAAACCCCTTTGGGAAAGCAT")

# call my function "complement_transcribe_translate" from above
complement_transcribe_translate(___)

# call my function "reverse_complement_transcribe_translate" from above
reverse_complement_transcribe_translate(___)
```
