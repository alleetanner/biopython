The words **library**, **module** and **package** roughly mean the same thing; it is entirely natural to be confused by this!
- **Library** : a collection of python files that expand the ability of python, using the `import` command. These are like accessories or modifications, typically giving you access to powerful, professional functions and classes written by collaborations of expert coders.
  - A library can be [standard](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) (it comes built into python), for example `time` or `math`, or
  - 3rd party, so, not a core part of python itself and will need to be installed.
- **Package** : a library that is available for delivery to a package manager, such as `pip` or `conda`. [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) is the main package storehouse for python.
- **Module** : anything that is imported to a main running script. Libraries and packages are made of modules.

### Python experience
To get the most out of this session, you should have some experience with Python. In particular, you should
* have experience to beginner or intermediate level Python - for example, having attended our sessions on either of these would be an ideal introduction
* be familiar with the biological background to genetics or genomics. For example, knowing the relationships between nucleotides and amino acids and having a general knowledge of what these are and what they do is sufficient.
* bdbkj
* some experience of using the [command line](https://alleetanner.github.io/intro-to-command-line/) is also expected.

We will recap some important coding concepts like `import`ing, creating functions using `def`, and how to work with dataframes. Streamlit encourages a "linear" coding style, and uses the Pandas dataframe as a foundation.sdfio no

### Installing required software
You will need Python version 3.10 or higher installed on your machine. You can check what version you have installed with the command `python3 --version`. If you need to upgrade, search for a guide to follow on how to do that for your operating system.

We also need to install some packages
