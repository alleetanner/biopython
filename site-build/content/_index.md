### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

[Biopython](https://biopython.org/) is a Python library for working with DNA, RNA and protein sequences. In this course we will introduce some of the basics of Biopython and how it can support your workflows. The library has a [range of features](https://biopython.org/docs/latest/api/Bio.html#subpackages) to help with molecular sequence work, including:

- standard operations on sequences such as transcription, complements and translation,
- reading and writing many common file formats such as FASTA, GenBank and BLAST,
- running tools like Blast directly,
- and support for performing alignments, for downstream tasks such as phylogenetic inference.

By the end of this workshop, you will have
- an overview of the capabilities of BioPython
- some practical experience of acquiring, managing and analysing sequence data
- gained some familiarity with major sequence repositories
- become familiar with communities where you can find answers to code questions
- built a small dataset, and done some analysis on it.
