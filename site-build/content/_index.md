### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

[Biopython](https://biopython.org/) is a Python library for working with DNA, RNA and protein sequences. It has a wide catalogue of functions, for operations such as converting between nucleotide and amino acids, sequence alignment and working with BLAST when searching genomic data. It also allows data to be retrieved from genetic data repositories (digital stores of sequence information produced by research laboratory globally) such as NCBI GenBank and Ensemble.

In this course we will introduce some of the basics of Biopython and how it can support you in your workflows. The library has a range of features needed for this kind of work, including:

- standard operations on sequences such as transcription, complements and translation,
- reading and writing many common file formats such as FASTA, GenBank and BLAST,
- accessing many online databases such as NCBI,
- running tools like Blast directly,
- and support for performing alignments, for downstream tasks such as phylogenetic inference.

 It will focus on Biopython as a tool to do your job and less on the specifics of bioinformatics as a research field.

By the end of this workshop, you will have
- an overview of the capabilities of BioPython
- some practical experience of acquiring, managing and analysing sequence data
- gained some familiarity with major sequence repositories
- become familiar with communities where you can find answers to code questions
- built a small dataset, and done some analysis on it.
