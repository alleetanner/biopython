    <description><![CDATA[Multiple Alignment Sequences Multiple Sequence Alignments are a collection of sequences which have been arranged vertically, usually with the insertion of gap characters, such that all the sequence strings are the same length. Each position along an alignment is an assertion of homology: we are expressing an evolutionary relationship between each nucleotide, codon, or amino acid (characteristics of the genotype). This is directly analagous to a character matrix, where our observations are on expressed phenotypes.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Input GenBank files We&rsquo;ll start by looking at the contents of a GenBank file. Through this you will also learn how to use urllib, a standard Python library for getting raw data from internet pages. Create a new file, and add these lines
import urllib url = &#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alleetanner/biopython/main/resources/sonichh_gopherus.gbk&#34; urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, &#34;sonic-hh-gopherus.gbk&#34;) urllib is being asked to go to an address (first argument), and save it in a file called sonic-hh-gopherus.gbk (the second argument).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Sequence repositories While basic methods of sequencing have existed since the 1970s, it is in the 21st century that the field exploded. This was due to key technological advancements, collectively known as &ldquo;high-throughput&rdquo; or &ldquo;next-generation&rdquo; sequencing. Generating high-quality sequences, at a fraction of the price, made genomics accessible to even modest research groups.
The genetic revolution To illustrate this, sequencing a human genome in 2000 required many specialist research groups, several years, and $100 million dollars ; by 2010 this had dropped to a matter of weeks and $100,000.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[BioPython&rsquo;s Seq class Seq is a class in the BioPython library - which means that we have both data (in this case, sequence information) and functions attributed to the object. Since those functions are part of a class, they are also known as &ldquo;methods&rdquo;. If this is confusing, don&rsquo;t worry too much! It just means that we can make special strings with Seq, and each also has special actions that can be done to it.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Anaconda and Jupyter Lab In order to provide a consistent interface, we will be using Jupyter Lab as our workspace. If you are familiar with other tools, such as PyCharm or VSCode, you are welcome to use these, but be sure you can also handle the specific requirements for your set up (ie, how to install packages and how to access the terminal).
If you haven&rsquo;t already, download Anaconda . Anaconda is a platform providing data science tools for Python and R.]]></description>
